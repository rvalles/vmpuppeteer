vmpuppeteer
===========
This is vmpuppeteer, a virtual machine server which isn't tied to a single vm
implementation.

It's targeted at having a simple mechanism for managing virtual machines which
can be controlled from an XMLRPC interface.

Configuration, Virtual machines and the disk database are defined in XML,
following XML Schema skeletons.

It currently supports Qemu and, by extension, KVM.

A client and a web frontend using cherrypy and mako are provided.

The original version of vmpuppeteer was written as a project (TFC) during my
comp-sci studies in Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.


Cloning
-------

    git clone git://github.com/rvalles/vmpuppeteer


Installing
----------
For the server to run, libxml2 and its bindings should be installed and the
config.xml and disks.xml configuration files should exist. Examples can be
found in the skel directory.

The web frontend needs the cherrypy http framework and the mako template
engine properly installed and the config.txt configuration file should exist.
An example can be found in the skel directory.


Using
-----
To run server, client or web frontend launch main.py on their respective
directories.

Client and web frontend need parameters to work. Use --help as parameter for 
more information.

Disks and vm definition files can be added through the client. Refer to the
example vm definitions found in the skel dir.
